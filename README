SUBJECT
--------

RoboTower [1] , a Tower Defense Hi-CoRG (Higly Competitive RoboGame) based on Meccano's Spykee robot.
Aim of this project is to develop a strategic realtime Robogame, based on the idea of a "Tower defense" 
(a game in which the player has to defend an object, that is the "tower", from an attack pursued by the enemy).
A mobile robot should try to ruin down the enemy tower in a given amount of time.
The human player has to prevent this by acquiring obstacles and putting them on the game field, 
either at the beginning of the game, or during the game, by buying obstacles from a computer dispenser.


Ver. 1.0 (2012-03-21)
Warning: this is an _extremely_ preliminar version. This code could - and it's very likely that does - not work!!!


USAGE
--------

This project is being developed on the Linux operating system.
You need to install the ROS middleware [2] to compile and execute the code in this repository. Furthermore, some
part of the code need the OpenCV libraries to be installed on your system (this should be automatically done by ROS)
and the ANN ROS package (you can download it on [3]).
To use the code, you need the Spykee robot together with some sonars and leds that have been added later to our robot.
If you have a different hardware (robot and\or sonar interface card), you need to adapt the software.


COMPILING
------------

To compile, the command
    rosmake
(entered on every ROS package in the repository, aka directory with a source tree) should work.
Known issues\notices:
* You should have configured ROS so that the directory in which you clone the repository is part of the ROS workspace.
* If compilation fails, try to remove the Cmake cache from the package directory.

EXECUTION
----------

To start the software, you can simple enter
    roslaunch spykee.launch
in the main directory (the one in which you cloned the repo).
